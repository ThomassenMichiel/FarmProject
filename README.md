# FarmProject
This is a repository of Y, L and M's JavaDev course.

## Idea
We run a farm.\
Currently, we only have a set amount of cows, a set amount of storage and a milk them daily.\
Each day, there are random visitors that buy fresh milk.\
Once the tank is full, they will be sold wholesale.\

## Research
* A cow produces about 22.3l of milk per day
* Average dairy farms hold 153 cows
* Milk is stored up to 48 hours before being sold wholesale
* Milking cows eat up to 45.3kg of food each day
